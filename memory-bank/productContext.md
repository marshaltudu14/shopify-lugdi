# Product Context: Lugdi Storefront

## 1. Problem Space

Users globally lack easy access to the unique fashion offerings of the Lugdi brand, which blends cultural heritage with modern streetwear aesthetics. Existing platforms might not effectively showcase the brand's specific identity or provide a tailored shopping experience for different regions.

## 2. Goals

- Provide a dedicated, branded online platform for Lugdi fashion.
- Enable global customers to discover and purchase Lugdi products easily.
- Offer a seamless and intuitive shopping experience, from browsing to cart management.
- Tailor the experience for users in different countries (initially through language and potentially currency/product availability via Shopify Markets).
- Reflect the brand's unique identity: "bold fashion brand merging cultural heritage with modern style... artistic graphic T-shirts, luxury streetwear... inspired by mythology, futuristic aesthetics, and abstract art."

## 3. User Experience

- **Discovery:** Users should easily find products through clear navigation (collections), visual browsing, and search functionality.
- **Internationalization:** Users should ideally be directed to or be able to select their country/region, seeing relevant content (language). The URL structure (`/[country]/...`) supports this.
- **Shopping:** Adding items to the cart, viewing the cart, and proceeding towards checkout (likely via Shopify) should be straightforward.
- **Visual Appeal:** The site should be visually engaging, using the brand's specified fonts (Blippo, Baumans) and aesthetic. Users should be able to toggle between light and dark themes based on their preference.
- **Performance:** The site should load quickly and feel responsive.
