# Project Progress: Lugdi Storefront (Initial Assessment)

## 1. What Works / Implemented Features (Inferred)

- **Core Setup:** Next.js project initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui.
- **Routing:** App Router structure implemented with dynamic routes for countries, products, collections, search, cart, etc.
- **Basic Layout:** Global Header, Footer, ThemeProvider, ApolloWrapper established. Custom fonts loaded. Dynamic metadata generation based on country context.
- **Theming:** Implemented a custom "Gold Theme" using CSS variables (`app/globals.css`) for light/dark modes, including gradients and shadows. Applied theme to base components (Button, Card) and specific pages (Cart, Footer). Added selective "Sun Glow" effect (`glowing-effect.tsx`) to primary buttons and product cards.
- **Cart System:** Client-side cart functionality (add, remove, update, view) implemented using React Context (`CartContext`) and Shopify GraphQL mutations. Cart state is persisted securely in encrypted `localStorage`. Corrected cart total display to use `subtotalAmount`. Enhanced cart page UI/UX with gold theme elements.
- **Internationalization Foundation:** URL structure (`/[country]/`) supports country contexts. `lib/countries.ts` likely holds country data. Country code is used in layout and cart API calls. A `CountriesCombobox.tsx` exists.
- **Component Structure:** Various UI components (Shadcn, custom like `ProductCard`, `BannerCarousel`) are present. Client components exist for key pages (Cart, Product, Collection, Search). Footer component styled with gold theme.
- **API Integration:** Apollo Client is configured. GraphQL queries and mutations for Shopify Storefront API (cart, likely products/collections) are defined. An API route for GraphQL (`/api/graphql`) exists, possibly for proxying or schema stitching, though direct Storefront API calls seem more likely based on `CartContext`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Verify

- **Feature Completeness:** Verify the full functionality and UI implementation of:
  - Product Detail Pages (Add to Cart button has glow effect)
  - Collection Pages
  - Search Results Page
  - Homepage content (`app/page.tsx`)
  - Country selection mechanism (`CountriesCombobox.tsx` integration)
  - "Coming Soon" page functionality
  - Error handling pages/logic
- **Checkout Flow:** Confirm the transition from the cart page (Checkout button has glow effect) to the Shopify checkout URL.
- **Authentication:** Determine if user authentication (`next-auth`) is required and/or implemented. If so, integrate login, logout, profile views, etc.
- **Zustand Integration:** Clarify if and where Zustand is used for state management.
- **Middleware Logic:** Investigate `middleware.ts` to understand its role (e.g., default country redirection, auth protection).
- **Shopify Backend Sync:** Ensure frontend reflects data accurately from Shopify (products, inventory, pricing, potentially markets).
- **Footer Links:** Policy links in the footer are currently hardcoded and point to '#'. Need to update with actual URLs or implement dynamic fetching later.
- **Testing:** Define and implement a testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e).
- **Deployment:** Configure deployment environment and CI/CD pipeline.
- **Optimization:** Further performance tuning (image optimization, code splitting, caching strategies).

## 3. Current Status

- Initial Memory Bank documentation established based on code analysis.
- Core technical stack and architectural patterns identified.
- Basic cart and internationalization structures are in place.
- Ready for specific task assignments.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- None identified yet, pending deeper code review and testing.

## 5. Evolution of Decisions

- (Initial State) Project structure suggests a headless Shopify approach using Next.js.
- (Initial State) Cart state management uses React Context with encryption, not Zustand.
- (Update) Implemented Gold Theme with gradients, shadows, and glow effects.
- (Update) Corrected cart total display and enhanced cart page UI.
- (Update) Styled footer to match gold theme.
- (Decision) Footer policy links will remain hardcoded for now.
