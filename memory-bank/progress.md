# Project Progress: Lugdi Storefront (Initial Assessment)

## 1. What Works / Implemented Features (Inferred)

- **Core Setup:** Next.js project initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui.
- **Routing:** App Router structure implemented with dynamic routes for countries, products, collections, search, cart, etc.
- **Basic Layout:** Global Header, Footer, ThemeProvider, ApolloWrapper established. Custom fonts loaded. Dynamic metadata generation based on country context.
- **Theming:** Removed previous dynamic/seasonal theme system. Now uses a standard black & white theme for light/dark modes defined via CSS variables in `app/globals.css`. Removed "Gold Theme" and "Sun Glow" effects. Updated coupon bar styling.
- **Cart System:** Client-side cart functionality (add, remove, update, view) implemented using React Context (`CartContext`) and Shopify GraphQL mutations. Cart state is persisted securely in encrypted `localStorage`. Corrected cart total display to use `subtotalAmount`. Removed gold theme elements.
- **Internationalization Foundation:** URL structure (`/[country]/`) supports country contexts. `lib/countries.ts` likely holds country data. Country code is used in layout and cart API calls. A `CountriesCombobox.tsx` exists.
- **Component Structure:** Various UI components (Shadcn, custom like `ProductCard`, `BannerCarousel`) are present. Client components exist for key pages (Cart, Product, Collection, Search, Wishlist). Footer component uses base theme. `ProductCard` used consistently (including on Wishlist page). Product images standardized to 2:3 aspect ratio. Discount badge styling updated.
- **API Integration:** Apollo Client is configured. GraphQL queries and mutations for Shopify Storefront API (cart, products, collections, wishlist details) are defined. An API route for GraphQL (`/api/graphql`) exists.
- **Wishlist:** Client-side wishlist functionality implemented using React Context (`WishlistContext`). Wishlist page fetches variant details and displays items using `ProductCard`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Verify

- **Feature Completeness:** Verify the full functionality and UI implementation of:
  - Collection Pages
  - Search Results Page
  - Homepage content (`app/page.tsx`)
  - Country selection mechanism (`CountriesCombobox.tsx` integration)
  - "Coming Soon" page functionality
  - Error handling pages/logic
- **Checkout Flow:** Confirm the transition from the cart page to the Shopify checkout URL.
- **Authentication:** Custom authentication using Shopify Customer Account API tokens is implemented in `middleware.ts`, protecting the `/account` route and handling token refresh. `next-auth` dependency is unused.
- **Zustand Integration:** Dependency exists, but no usage found in the codebase. State management relies on React Context (Cart, Wishlist) and local state.
- **Middleware Logic:** `middleware.ts` is implemented and handles:
  - Country detection (cookie/IP) and redirection for inactive countries or incorrect URL structure.
  - Setting country cookies.
  - Authentication token validation and refresh for protected routes (`/account`).
- **Shopify Backend Sync:** Ensure frontend reflects data accurately from Shopify (products, inventory, pricing, potentially markets).
- **Footer Links:** Policy links in the footer are currently hardcoded and point to '#'. Need to update with actual URLs or implement dynamic fetching later.
- **Testing:** Define and implement a testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e).
- **Deployment:** Configure deployment environment and CI/CD pipeline.
- **Optimization:** Further performance tuning (image optimization, code splitting, caching strategies).

## 3. Current Status

- Initial Memory Bank documentation established based on code analysis.
- Core technical stack and architectural patterns identified.
- Basic cart and internationalization structures are in place.
- Ready for specific task assignments.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- None identified yet, pending deeper code review and testing.

## 5. Evolution of Decisions

- (Initial State) Project structure suggests a headless Shopify approach using Next.js.
- (Initial State) Cart state management uses React Context with encryption. (Zustand dependency exists but is unused).
- (Update) Removed Gold Theme and seasonal/festival theme system. Reverted to standard black/white theme.
- (Update) Corrected cart total display.
- (Update) Removed gold theme styling from Footer.
- (Update) Standardized product image aspect ratio to 2:3.
- (Update) Refactored Wishlist page to use ProductCard.
- (Update) Updated discount badge styling.
- (Decision) Footer policy links will remain hardcoded for now.
