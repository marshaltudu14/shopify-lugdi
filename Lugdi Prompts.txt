I want a prompt for leonardo ai, 
where I want to generate a graphics design for a tshirt. 
The design is about 
- a rectangle box with a famous anime character eyes starting -.
Make it very appealing visually and choose the stlye concept 
etc so that I can use this generated graphics design 
in my tshirt. 
Also tell me whether this design would look better 
on front or back of the tshirt. 
And where else I can use other designs to further 
enhacne the visuals of the tshirt. 
I dont want the tshirt, I want the graphics design which 
I can print on it. Do you understand?


How can we further enhance this design? 
I want it to be visually appealing and 
look premium good on the cloth. 
Also the rectangle must act as a frame 
inside which the eyes must be there. 
Outside the rectangle, there will be nothing and 
a plain background. And should we make colorful 
or a single color or black and white etc?
